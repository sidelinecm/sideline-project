# ================================
# Notes & Recommendations (not parsed by Netlify)
# ================================
# 1) Keep sw.js at repo root (publish = ".") so /sw.js is an actual file deployed to site root.
# 2) Ensure service worker code does not import remote scripts that are blocked by CSP,
#    or add required CDN origins into the CSP connect/script-src if you must import them.
# 3) For Supabase images, change client URLs to use Supabase image renderer with width & quality parameters:
#    https://<project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/render/image/public/profile-images/ID.webp?width=300&quality=65
# 4) Use filename hashing (e.g., main.abc123.js) so long-term Cache-Control is safe.
# 5) If using Realtime (websocket), confirm the connect-src includes wss://*.supabase.co (already included).
# 6) Test in production preview; Netlify's preview URL may behave differently for service workers —
#    always test the published production domain (or set a proper custom domain) when verifying SW registration.
